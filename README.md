# Integer Factorization Algorithms
### Yiheng Su

Integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of smaller integers. ``Can integer factorization be solved in polynomial times?'' It is a famous unsolved problem in computer science and mathematics. Till today, no classical algorithm is known that can factor integers in polynomial time. However, neither the non-existence of such algorithms has been proved.

In this article, I will introduce five integer factorization algorithms and compare the runtimes between them. Firstly, I will describe the most straightforward algorithm, the trial division, and the wheel factorization improvement. Secondly, I will describe Fermat's factorization method and its improvement, Kraitchik-Fermat's factorization method. Thirdly, I will focus on a more intriguing and complicated algorithm called Pollard's $p-1$ factorization. Lastly, I will compare the runtimes between different algorithms on factoring various composite integers.
